The first step is to flash the img of the OS on your SD card. Raspbian (a version of Debian Linux for Raspberry Pi) seems to be the standard. The current implementation is called Jessie. Two options are available for download – Jessie and Jessie Lite. Jessie contains a GUI and some useful software. Jessie is much simpler and only provides a command line interface. 

** Jessie is now Stretch  (Wheezy-> Jesse-> Stretch)

The Jessie download is over 4GB. The classroom kits to which I am restricted are 4GB SD card. I have a larger card, but not a classrooms worth. I will demonstrate how to load Jessie Lite on the 4GB card and all other instructions will focus on Jessie Lite. All commands from Jessie Lite run on Jessie, however Jessie may offer graphical interfaces to modify these same settings. 

If you have a spacious SD card, you can also use NOOBS to setup the OS, but with the restrictions above, I will not be trying it here. 

Download Jessie/Jessie Lite here - https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

Follow these instructions on creating Jessie images and flashing the SD cards
 - Use Etcher, Windows/Mac  - https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md
 - Use dd (commandline Mac) - https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md

My goals for setup:
 - setup wired and wireless networks
 - enable ssh
 - enable uart (serial communication) in case I want to use a command console cable

Wired Ehternet - setting a temporary static IP in order to connect through ssh. Once booted, we can change the settings to modify that permanently or allow for dynamic addressing  - we will give a unicue host name so we can access the device by name instead of ip

(see https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=24993 and https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/19668676-renaming-your-raspberry-pi-the-hostnames)

edit cmdline.txt so it looks like the statement below. (only the last part is changed – ip:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. where xxx is your desired ip address)  You can aslo use a program like nmap to probe the networks and try to find the correct ip.

dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=a8790229-02 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet init=/usr/lib/raspi-config/init_resize.sh ip=10.0.0.142

setup wireless (optional) 
we can set this up after connecting with the Ethernet cord, but we can also do it at boot. [Add a file called wpa_supplicant.conf in the boot folder. after boot, these settings can be changed in /etc/wpa-supplicant/wpa-supplicat.conf] **this sometimes works, it may be the settings aren't quite correct**

Add this to the WPA supplicant file: (http://weworkweplay.com/play/automatically-connect-a-raspberry-pi-to-a-wifi-network/, https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/08/connect-multiple-wireless-networks-raspberry-pi/)

country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
 
network={
    ssid="network_ssid_here"
    psk="wpa_password_here"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

for command console through serial (requires a console cable)

enabling ssh
 - use raspi-config if you have a monitor and keyboard
 - Headless - This could not be easier! With the SD card connected to a computer, just create a blank file in the root directory called “ssh” – no extension. When the Pi boots, it will  see this file, enable ssh and delete the file. https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/#


Enable uart (optional)
for command console through serial (requires a console cable)
- with monitor - rasppi-config
- headless - Edit config.txt. Add these lines at the end of the file.
	##enable serial com 
	enable_uart=1

Boot the Pi for the first time

After boot you can edit some files to finishing configuring your settings. 

SSh into your device using the ip specified at boot. The default username is pi and the password is raspberry

change your password using the passwd command

Setting the hostname - choose one
1. Use raspi-config
2. to create a unique host name two files need to be edited
	sudo nano /ect/hosts

	hosts should look like this
	127.0.0.1       localhost
	::1             localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
	ff02::1         ip6-allnodes
	ff02::2         ip6-allrouters

	127.0.1.1      	raspberrypi

	modify the last line to a unique hostname like
	127.0.1.1      	penta-raz-pi

	save and close the file 

	sudo nano /etc/hostnames
	remove any hostname and add the one you created above
	save and exit

Shutdown the pi
( if you are doing a headless setup and set a static ip, then remove the sd card. edit the commandline text to remove the ip added in that step)
reboot the pi with the sd card

ssh into the pi using the address using the host name: ssh pi@penta-raz-pi.local

setting up apache/php
https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/lamp-web-server-with-wordpress/worksheet/ (I will skip mysql and the wordpress part)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 -y
sudo apt-get install mysql-server php5-mysql -y
sudo service apache2 restart

you can use the hostname.local in the browser or the ip address to access the site - http://hostname.local

all webfiles are in /var/www/html
you will need to use sudo to edit those files or you can change the ownership of them to your user (sudo chown)
